# Improved_DBO_IK
Inverse Kinematics Calculation and Control of Redundant Robot Arm Based on Improved Dung Beetle Optimizer Algorithm;
1st: file of "Original DBO", try to solve inverse kinematics problem;
2ond: file of "Other SI algorithm for IK", Comparing the performance of the DBO algorithm with other state-of-the-art algorithms (GWO, WOA, ALO, and SSA);
3rd: file of "Improved DBO for IK", modified DBO algorithm to Improved_DBO algorithm as 'Improved_DBO.m'; 
run "test_rbt_ik_main.m" 
"test_rbt_ik_Function" 3 different Function
All data in file "draw curve"
4th: file "Draw curve" all result of data
5th: file "Application_IK_simulink" for simulation based on MATLAB/Simulink.
- M-DH parameters of the robot Arm
- Robot Visual Simulation
- Block diagram of robot inverse kinematics controller
- Values of the 6 joint angles
- Values of end effector
- Corresponding hardware

Disadvantages: The design of the controller has not been carried out to ensure the accuracy of the work. The team will further improve it in the follow-up work.
